# Pong game
Hi, I wrote pong using pygame. 1 player and 2 player modes are available. 
For 1 player, I wrote an algorithm to play against you at different difficulty levels (see [here](https://github.com/DeathPacito6/pong-game/blob/master/GameComponents/AlgorithmBrain.py#L76) for the algorithm).
I tried to train a neural network to play against but I couldnt figure out how. I might come back later if I learn more about machine learning :)

# Installation Instructions
 You can run steps 2 and 3 in a virtual environment (`python -m venv .venv`) if you dont want to install the requirements globally.

- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/DeathPacito6/pong-game/`
- Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the game with `python main.py`
- Enjoy!
